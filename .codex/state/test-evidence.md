- `pnpm codex:validate`: 17 routes, 4 profiles and 8 skills valid.
- Verified structure, JSON-compatible YAML 1.2, route limits, escalation, CRITICAL checkpoint,
  agent limits, roadmap consistency and absence of operational legacy backup paths.
- `pnpm verify`: passed; 98 test files passed, 344 tests passed, 4 documented skips.
